Bleeding heart - P2P actiware fighting network censorship by the CCP authoritarian government.

This piece of software is designed to run under the cover on a user's computer. The user is aware of its presence and should be actively consuming data brought down by it from the network. However, the user also has the ability to deny the knowledge of it being installed on his computer. BH is designed such that it is almost invisible to an unsophiscated average computer user. The authority has little to bring charge against the user whose computer happened to be running BH as it might just be a result of user mistakenly clicked a link in a spam email.

With BH, we aim to build a large scale P2P content sharing network inside mainland Chinese that is:
* censorship resistant
* scalable
